# bad-bank
A simple banking application, called "bad-bank" because it has no security features. This is good practice in using react as well as for learning about backend and database connections. 

## How to Run
First clone the working repository (git clone: git@github.com:Leasman7/bad-bank.git).
Run "npm install" to install necessary dependencies (express, mongodb, cors).
Run "node index.js" to get app up and running on your local machine. Navigate to localhost:3000 to see UI, which allows you to create users, deposit and withdraw, view balances, and list all data for created users.

## Technology Used:
React,
Node,
Express,
Cors,
MongoDB, and
Docker

## Features and Roadmap
This app features styling through bootstrap, components that load onto a single page using react, and the use of mongodb for holding the user information. You can use the app to create a user, make deposits or withdrawals that add to or subtract from a current balance, and display all of the current user data. Further functionality is needed, such as validation for creating account, full connection to the database, and the ability to login.
